## Supported Versions

Only the docker image with the latest version of QGIS is supported with security
updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability in the latest docker image, email the maintainer
olivier.benz@b-data.ch.

## Vulnerabilities in Prior Versions

Vulnerabilities in docker images with prior versions of QGIS are not fixed.

Whenever a new version of QGIS is released, the previous version's docker image
is rebuilt once again and then frozen.

Docker images *may* be rebuilt or extended if they fail to start or have runtime
issues.
